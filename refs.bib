abstract = {Most chronic diseases—such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, arthritis, diabetes and obesity—are becoming leading causes of disability and death all over the world. Some of the most common causes of these age-associated chronic diseases are lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. All the risk factors linked to these chronic diseases have been shown to up-regulate inflammation. Therefore, downregulation of inflammation-associated risk factors could prevent or delay these age-associated diseases. Although modern science has developed several drugs for treating chronic diseases, most of these drugs are enormously expensive and are associated with serious side effects and morbidity. In this review, we present evidence on how chronic inflammation leads to age-associated chronic disease. Furthermore, we discuss diet and lifestyle as solutions for age-associated chronic disease.}

abstract = {Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. Endogenous cellular processes such as aerobic metabolism generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interact with DNA to form dozens of DNA lesions. If unrepaired, these lesions can exert a number of deleterious effects including the induction of mutations. In an effort to understand the genetic consequences of cellular oxidative damage, many laboratories have determined the patterns of mutations generated by the interaction of ROS with DNA. Compilation of these mutational spectra has revealed that GC → AT transitions and GC → TA transversions are the most commonly observed mutations resulting from oxidative damage to DNA. Since mutational spectra convey only the end result of a complex cascade of events, which includes formation of multiple adducts, repair processing, and polymerase errors, it is difficult if not impossible to asses the mutational specificity of individual DNA lesions directly from these spectra. This problem is especially complicated in the case of oxidative DNA damage owing to the multiplicity of lesions formed by a single damaging agent. The task of assigning specific features of mutational spectra to individual DNA lesions has been made possible with the advent of a technology to analyze the mutational properties of single defined adducts, in vitro and in vivo. At the same time, parallel progress in the discovery and cloning of repair enzymes has advanced understanding of the biochemical mechanisms by which cells excise DNA damage. This combination of tools has brought our understanding of DNA lesions to a new level of sophistication. In this review, we summarize the known properties of individual oxidative lesions in terms of their structure, mutagenicity and repairability.}

The complexity of the aging process has stimulated the use of computational modelling in order to increase our understanding of the system, test hypotheses and make testable predictions. As many different mechanisms are involved, a wide range of models have been developed. This paper gives an overview of the types of models that have been developed, the range of tools used, modelling standards and discusses many specific examples of models that have been grouped according to the main mechanisms that they address. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges for future modelling in this field.}",

Inhibition of TRF2 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends, manifested by loss of the telomeric 3′ overhang, activation of p53, and end-to-end chromosome fusions. Electron microscopy reported here demonstrated that TRF2 can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding of TRF1 and single strand binding protein suggested that t loops are formed by invasion of the 3′ telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. T loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and replication of telomeres.}

  abstract = {The exact causes of aging are still not understood, and it is unclear why some species live less than 1 d, while others can live more than 400 y. Research suggests that telomeres are related to the aging process, but a clear relationship between the life span of a species and initial telomere length has not been observed. Here, we measure the telomere lengths of a variety of different species. We find that, in fact, there is no strong correlation between the life span of a species and initial telomere length. However, we find a strong correlation between the telomere shortening rate and the life span of a species. Telomere shortening to a critical length can trigger aging and shorter life spans in mice and humans by a mechanism that involves induction of a persistent DNA damage response at chromosome ends and loss of cellular viability. However, whether telomere length is a universal determinant of species longevity is not known. To determine whether telomere shortening can be a single parameter to predict species longevities, here we measured in parallel the telomere length of a wide variety of species (birds and mammals) with very different life spans and body sizes, including mouse (Mus musculus), goat (Capra hircus), Audouin’s gull (Larus audouinii), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), and Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). We found that the telomere shortening rate, but not the initial telomere length alone, is a powerful predictor of species life span. These results support the notion that critical telomere shortening and the consequent onset of telomeric DNA damage and cellular senescence are a general determinant of species life span.}

abstract = {The query engines of most modern database systems are either based on vectorization or data-centric code generation. These two state-of-the-art query processing paradigms are fundamentally different in terms of system structure and query execution code. Both paradigms were used to build fast systems. However, until today it is not clear which paradigm yields faster query execution, as many implementation-specific choices obstruct a direct comparison of architectures. In this paper, we experimentally compare the two models by implementing both within the same test system. This allows us to use for both models the same query processing algorithms, the same data structures, and the same parallelization framework to ultimately create an apples-to-apples comparison. We find that both are efficient, but have different strengths and weaknesses. Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which benefits cache-resident workloads. Besides raw, single-threaded performance, we also investigate SIMD as well as multi-core parallelization and different hardware architectures. Finally, we analyze qualitative differences as a guide for system architects.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The consistent and unambiguous description of sequence variants is essential to report and exchange information on the analysis of a genome. In particular, DNA diagnostics critically depends on accurate and standardized description and sharing of the variants detected. The sequence variant nomenclature system proposed in 2000 by the Human Genome Variation Society has been widely adopted and has developed into an internationally accepted standard. The recommendations are currently commissioned through a Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG) operating under the auspices of three international organizations: the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS), the Human Variome Project (HVP), and the Human Genome Organization (HUGO). Requests for modifications and extensions go through the SVD-WG following a standard procedure including a community consultation step. Version numbers are assigned to the nomenclature system to allow users to specify the version used in their variant descriptions. Here, we present the current recommendations, HGVS version 15.11, and briefly summarize the changes that were made since the 2000 publication. Most focus has been on removing inconsistencies and tightening definitions allowing automatic data processing. An extensive version of the recommendations is available online, at http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen.},

Our estimates show that genomics is a “four-headed beast”—it is either on par with or the most demanding of the domains analyzed here in terms of data acquisition, storage, distribution, and analysis. We discuss aspects of new technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational challenges that genomics poses for the near future.

It predicts variant molecular consequences using the Ensembl/GENCODE or RefSeq gene sets. It also reports phenotype associations from databases such as ClinVar, allele frequencies from studies including gnomAD, and predictions of deleteriousness from tools such as Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion. Ensembl VEP includes filtering options to customize variant prioritization. It is well supported and updated roughly quarterly to incorporate the latest gene, variant, and phenotype association information. Ensembl VEP analysis can be performed using a highly configurable, extensible command-line tool, a Representational State Transfer application programming interface, and a user-friendly web interface. These access methods are designed to suit different levels of bioinformatics experience and meet different needs in terms of data size, visualization, and flexibility. In this tutorial, we will describe performing variant annotation using the Ensembl VEP web tool, which enables sophisticated analysis through a simple interface.},

To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a ‘variants reduction’ protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.}",
