abstract = {Most chronic diseases—such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, arthritis, diabetes and obesity—are becoming leading causes of disability and death all over the world. Some of the most common causes of these age-associated chronic diseases are lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. All the risk factors linked to these chronic diseases have been shown to up-regulate inflammation. Therefore, downregulation of inflammation-associated risk factors could prevent or delay these age-associated diseases. Although modern science has developed several drugs for treating chronic diseases, most of these drugs are enormously expensive and are associated with serious side effects and morbidity. In this review, we present evidence on how chronic inflammation leads to age-associated chronic disease. Furthermore, we discuss diet and lifestyle as solutions for age-associated chronic disease.}

abstract = {Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. Endogenous cellular processes such as aerobic metabolism generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interact with DNA to form dozens of DNA lesions. If unrepaired, these lesions can exert a number of deleterious effects including the induction of mutations. In an effort to understand the genetic consequences of cellular oxidative damage, many laboratories have determined the patterns of mutations generated by the interaction of ROS with DNA. Compilation of these mutational spectra has revealed that GC → AT transitions and GC → TA transversions are the most commonly observed mutations resulting from oxidative damage to DNA. Since mutational spectra convey only the end result of a complex cascade of events, which includes formation of multiple adducts, repair processing, and polymerase errors, it is difficult if not impossible to asses the mutational specificity of individual DNA lesions directly from these spectra. This problem is especially complicated in the case of oxidative DNA damage owing to the multiplicity of lesions formed by a single damaging agent. The task of assigning specific features of mutational spectra to individual DNA lesions has been made possible with the advent of a technology to analyze the mutational properties of single defined adducts, in vitro and in vivo. At the same time, parallel progress in the discovery and cloning of repair enzymes has advanced understanding of the biochemical mechanisms by which cells excise DNA damage. This combination of tools has brought our understanding of DNA lesions to a new level of sophistication. In this review, we summarize the known properties of individual oxidative lesions in terms of their structure, mutagenicity and repairability.}

Although cells possess mechanisms to repair or remove damage, they are not 100\\% efficient and their efficiency declines with age. There are many molecular mechanisms involved and exogenous factors such as stress also contribute to the aging process. The complexity of the aging process has stimulated the use of computational modelling in order to increase our understanding of the system, test hypotheses and make testable predictions. As many different mechanisms are involved, a wide range of models have been developed. This paper gives an overview of the types of models that have been developed, the range of tools used, modelling standards and discusses many specific examples of models that have been grouped according to the main mechanisms that they address. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges for future modelling in this field.}",

abstract = {Mammalian telomeres contain a duplex array of telomeric repeats bound to the telomeric repeat–binding factors TRF1 and TRF2. Inhibition of TRF2 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends, manifested by loss of the telomeric 3′ overhang, activation of p53, and end-to-end chromosome fusions. Electron microscopy reported here demonstrated that TRF2 can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding of TRF1 and single strand binding protein suggested that t loops are formed by invasion of the 3′ telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. T loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and replication of telomeres.}
