abstract = {Most chronic diseases—such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, arthritis, diabetes and obesity—are becoming leading causes of disability and death all over the world. Some of the most common causes of these age-associated chronic diseases are lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. All the risk factors linked to these chronic diseases have been shown to up-regulate inflammation. Therefore, downregulation of inflammation-associated risk factors could prevent or delay these age-associated diseases. Although modern science has developed several drugs for treating chronic diseases, most of these drugs are enormously expensive and are associated with serious side effects and morbidity. In this review, we present evidence on how chronic inflammation leads to age-associated chronic disease. Furthermore, we discuss diet and lifestyle as solutions for age-associated chronic disease.}

abstract = {Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. Endogenous cellular processes such as aerobic metabolism generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interact with DNA to form dozens of DNA lesions. If unrepaired, these lesions can exert a number of deleterious effects including the induction of mutations. In an effort to understand the genetic consequences of cellular oxidative damage, many laboratories have determined the patterns of mutations generated by the interaction of ROS with DNA. Compilation of these mutational spectra has revealed that GC → AT transitions and GC → TA transversions are the most commonly observed mutations resulting from oxidative damage to DNA. Since mutational spectra convey only the end result of a complex cascade of events, which includes formation of multiple adducts, repair processing, and polymerase errors, it is difficult if not impossible to asses the mutational specificity of individual DNA lesions directly from these spectra. This problem is especially complicated in the case of oxidative DNA damage owing to the multiplicity of lesions formed by a single damaging agent. The task of assigning specific features of mutational spectra to individual DNA lesions has been made possible with the advent of a technology to analyze the mutational properties of single defined adducts, in vitro and in vivo. At the same time, parallel progress in the discovery and cloning of repair enzymes has advanced understanding of the biochemical mechanisms by which cells excise DNA damage. This combination of tools has brought our understanding of DNA lesions to a new level of sophistication. In this review, we summarize the known properties of individual oxidative lesions in terms of their structure, mutagenicity and repairability.}

The complexity of the aging process has stimulated the use of computational modelling in order to increase our understanding of the system, test hypotheses and make testable predictions. As many different mechanisms are involved, a wide range of models have been developed. This paper gives an overview of the types of models that have been developed, the range of tools used, modelling standards and discusses many specific examples of models that have been grouped according to the main mechanisms that they address. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges for future modelling in this field.}",

Inhibition of TRF2 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends, manifested by loss of the telomeric 3′ overhang, activation of p53, and end-to-end chromosome fusions. Electron microscopy reported here demonstrated that TRF2 can remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops (t loops) in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis of psoralen cross-linked telomeric DNA purified from human and mouse cells revealed abundant large t loops with a size distribution consistent with their telomeric origin. Binding of TRF1 and single strand binding protein suggested that t loops are formed by invasion of the 3′ telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. T loops may provide a general mechanism for the protection and replication of telomeres.}

  abstract = {The exact causes of aging are still not understood, and it is unclear why some species live less than 1 d, while others can live more than 400 y. Research suggests that telomeres are related to the aging process, but a clear relationship between the life span of a species and initial telomere length has not been observed. Here, we measure the telomere lengths of a variety of different species. We find that, in fact, there is no strong correlation between the life span of a species and initial telomere length. However, we find a strong correlation between the telomere shortening rate and the life span of a species. Telomere shortening to a critical length can trigger aging and shorter life spans in mice and humans by a mechanism that involves induction of a persistent DNA damage response at chromosome ends and loss of cellular viability. However, whether telomere length is a universal determinant of species longevity is not known. To determine whether telomere shortening can be a single parameter to predict species longevities, here we measured in parallel the telomere length of a wide variety of species (birds and mammals) with very different life spans and body sizes, including mouse (Mus musculus), goat (Capra hircus), Audouin’s gull (Larus audouinii), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), and Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). We found that the telomere shortening rate, but not the initial telomere length alone, is a powerful predictor of species life span. These results support the notion that critical telomere shortening and the consequent onset of telomeric DNA damage and cellular senescence are a general determinant of species life span.}

abstract = {The query engines of most modern database systems are either based on vectorization or data-centric code generation. These two state-of-the-art query processing paradigms are fundamentally different in terms of system structure and query execution code. Both paradigms were used to build fast systems. However, until today it is not clear which paradigm yields faster query execution, as many implementation-specific choices obstruct a direct comparison of architectures. In this paper, we experimentally compare the two models by implementing both within the same test system. This allows us to use for both models the same query processing algorithms, the same data structures, and the same parallelization framework to ultimately create an apples-to-apples comparison. We find that both are efficient, but have different strengths and weaknesses. Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which benefits cache-resident workloads. Besides raw, single-threaded performance, we also investigate SIMD as well as multi-core parallelization and different hardware architectures. Finally, we analyze qualitative differences as a guide for system architects.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The consistent and unambiguous description of sequence variants is essential to report and exchange information on the analysis of a genome. In particular, DNA diagnostics critically depends on accurate and standardized description and sharing of the variants detected. The sequence variant nomenclature system proposed in 2000 by the Human Genome Variation Society has been widely adopted and has developed into an internationally accepted standard. The recommendations are currently commissioned through a Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG) operating under the auspices of three international organizations: the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS), the Human Variome Project (HVP), and the Human Genome Organization (HUGO). Requests for modifications and extensions go through the SVD-WG following a standard procedure including a community consultation step. Version numbers are assigned to the nomenclature system to allow users to specify the version used in their variant descriptions. Here, we present the current recommendations, HGVS version 15.11, and briefly summarize the changes that were made since the 2000 publication. Most focus has been on removing inconsistencies and tightening definitions allowing automatic data processing. An extensive version of the recommendations is available online, at http://www.HGVS.org/varnomen.},

Our estimates show that genomics is a “four-headed beast”—it is either on par with or the most demanding of the domains analyzed here in terms of data acquisition, storage, distribution, and analysis. We discuss aspects of new technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational challenges that genomics poses for the near future.

It predicts variant molecular consequences using the Ensembl/GENCODE or RefSeq gene sets. It also reports phenotype associations from databases such as ClinVar, allele frequencies from studies including gnomAD, and predictions of deleteriousness from tools such as Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion. Ensembl VEP includes filtering options to customize variant prioritization. It is well supported and updated roughly quarterly to incorporate the latest gene, variant, and phenotype association information. Ensembl VEP analysis can be performed using a highly configurable, extensible command-line tool, a Representational State Transfer application programming interface, and a user-friendly web interface. These access methods are designed to suit different levels of bioinformatics experience and meet different needs in terms of data size, visualization, and flexibility. In this tutorial, we will describe performing variant annotation using the Ensembl VEP web tool, which enables sophisticated analysis through a simple interface.},

To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a ‘variants reduction’ protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.}",

These researches have outlined a complex scenario in which epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and numerous histone modifications, are emerging as important factors of the overall variation in life expectancy. In fact, epigenetic marks, that are responsible of the establishment of specific expression programs and of genome stability, represent a “drawbridge” across genetic, environmental and stochastic factors. In this review we provide an overview on the current knowledge and the general features of the epigenetic modifications characterizing the aging process.}

  abstract = {The organization of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin enables DNA to fit inside the nucleus while also regulating the access of proteins to the DNA to facilitate genomic functions such as transcription, replication and repair. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which includes 147bp of DNA wrapped 1.65 times around an octamer of core histone proteins comprising two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 [1]. Each nucleosome is a highly stable unit, being maintained by over 120 direct protein–DNA interactions and several hundred water mediated ones [1]. Accordingly, there is considerable interest in understanding how processive enzymes such as RNA polymerases manage to pass along the coding regions of our genes that are tightly packaged into arrays of nucleosomes. Here we present the current mechanistic understanding of this process and the evidence for profound changes in chromatin dynamics during aging.

  ABSTRACT = {Aging is the progressive decline or loss of function at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels that ultimately leads to death. A number of external and internal factors, including diet, exercise, metabolic dysfunction, genome instability, and epigenetic imbalance, affect the lifespan of an organism. These aging factors regulate transcriptome changes related to the aging process through chromatin remodeling. Many epigenetic regulators, such as histone modification, histone variants, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, play roles in chromatin reorganization. The key to understanding the role of gene regulatory networks in aging lies in characterizing the epigenetic regulators responsible for reorganizing and potentiating particular chromatin structures. This review covers epigenetic studies on aging, discusses the impact of epigenetic modifications on gene expression, and provides future directions in this area.},

Dysregulation of telomerase has often been found in developmental abnormalities, such as cancer, loss of function in the hematopoietic system, and low success rate of somatic cloning. A comprehensive network of transcription factors has been shown to be involved in the genetic control of telomerase expression and activity. Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been shown to provide an additional level of regulation, and may be responsible for the diverse expression status of telomerase that is manifested in a tissue and cell-type-dependent manner. This article summarizes the recent developments in the field of telomerase research with a focus on the coregulation of the telomerase gene by both genetic and epigenetic pathways. Developmental consequences of aberrant telomerase activity will also be summarized and discussed.}

This can be mimicked by culture manipulations such as Ras oncogene overexpression or treatment with various agents such as sodium butyrate and 5-azacytidine. It is believed that cellular senescence is one of the protective mechanisms against tumor formation. Genetic analyses of cellular senescence have revealed that it is dominant over immortality because whole cell fusion of normal with immortal cells yields hybrids with limited division potential. Only four complementation groups for indefinite division have been identified from extensive studies fusing different immortal human cell lines with each other. The senescence-related genes for three of the complementation groups B–D have been identified on human chromosomes 4, 1, and 7, respectively, by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, though the existence of senescence-related genes on other chromosomes has been suggested. MORF4 was cloned as the senescence-related gene on human chromosome 4 and is a member of a new gene family, which has multiple transcription factor-like motifs. This gene family may affect cell division by modulating gene expression. Study of this novel gene family should lead to new insights regarding the mechanisms and function of cellular senescence in aging and immortalization.}

  abstract = { Qk1 is a member of the KH domain family of proteins that includes Sam68, GRP33, GLD-1, SF1, and Who/How. These family members are RNA binding proteins that contain an extended KH domain embedded in a larger domain called the GSG (for GRP33–Sam68–GLD-1) domain. An ethylnitrosourea-induced point mutation in the Qk1 GSG domain alters glutamic acid 48 to a glycine and is known to be embryonically lethal in mice. The function of Qk1 and the GSG domain as well as the reason for the lethality are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Qk1 GSG domain mediates RNA binding and Qk1 self-association. By using in situ chemical cross-linking studies, we showed that the Qk1 proteins exist as homodimers in vivo. The Qk1 self-association region was mapped to amino acids 18 to 57, a region predicted to form coiled coils. Alteration of glutamic acid 48 to glycine (E➤G) in the Qk1 GSG domain (producing protein Qk1:E➤G) abolishes self-association but has no effect on the RNA binding activity. The expression of Qk1 or Qk1:E➤G in NIH 3T3 cells induces cell death by apoptosis. Approximately 90\% of the remaining transfected cells are apoptotic 48 h after transfection. Qk1:E➤G was consistently more potent at inducing apoptosis than was wild-type Qk1. These results suggest that the mousequaking lethality (E➤G) occurs due to the absence of Qk1 self-association mediated by the GSG domain. }

In addition, many acquired mutations in cancer introduce similar PTCs. In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. Since, many studies have validated this approach, but despite the promise of PTC readthrough therapies, the mechanisms of translation termination remain to be precisely elucidated before even more progress can be made. Here, we review the molecular basis for PTC readthrough in eukaryotes and describe currently available compounds with significant therapeutic potential for treating genetic disorders and cancer.}

  abstract = {Summary By studying the loci that contribute to human longevity, we aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to healthy aging. To identify such loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comparing 403 unrelated nonagenarians from long-living families included in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and 1670 younger population controls. The strongest candidate SNPs from this GWAS have been analyzed in a meta-analysis of nonagenarian cases from the Rotterdam Study, Leiden 85-plus study, and Danish 1905 cohort. Only one of the 62 prioritized SNPs from the GWAS analysis (P < 1 × 10−4) showed genome-wide significance with survival into old age in the meta-analysis of 4149 nonagenarian cases and 7582 younger controls [OR = 0.71 (95\% CI 0.65–0.77), P = 3.39 × 10−17]. This SNP, rs2075650, is located in TOMM40 at chromosome 19q13.32 close to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE ε4 defining SNP rs429358, we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses. As expected, rs429358 associated with metabolic phenotypes in the offspring of the nonagenarian cases from the LLS and their partners. In addition, we observed a novel association between this locus and serum levels of IGF-1 in women (P = 0.005). In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE ε4 allele. No other major longevity locus was found.},

However, the associations of ACE gene and protein level to AD are undetermined among Taiwanese.Methods: this study investigated 257 Taiwanese cases with AD and 137 ethnically matched controls using ACE gene indel genotype association methods with logistic regression adjusted for other variables. Besides, 65 out of 257 AD patients, 11 with D/D genotype, 28 with I/I genotype and 26 with I/D genotype were recruited. Their plasma ACE protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and compared for their corresponding ACE gene indel polymorphism.Results: patients with ACE-I/I homozygote were less likely to be associated with AD, compared with both I/D and D/D (OR: 0.601; 95\\% CI: 0.372–0.969; P = 0.037), or only I/D genotype (OR: 0.584; 95\\% CI: 0.349–0.976; P = 0.040). There were significantly different plasma ACE protein levels among these three different genotype groups (P = 0.023). The I/I genotype group had significantly lower ACE plasma levels [114.79 ± 31.32 ng/ml (mean ± SD)], compared with D/D (164.07 ± 86.36 ng/ml; P = 0.010), but not I/D (141.45 ± 51.50 ng/ml; P = 0.064).Conclusion: ACE-I/I homozygote corresponds to lower plasma ACE protein level and it is independently but less likely to be associated with AD. These findings signal the importance of ACE indel polymorphisms to their corresponding protein levels and to AD.}",

Owing to the complexity of the data, bioinformatics has become a necessary component in any laboratory implementing a clinical NGS test.The computational components of an NGS-based work flow can be conceptualized as primary, secondary, and tertiary analytics. Each of these components addresses a necessary step in the transformation of raw data into clinically actionable knowledge. Understanding the basic concepts of these analysis steps is important in assessing and addressing the informatics needs of a molecular diagnostics laboratory. Equally critical is a familiarity with the regulatory requirements addressing the bioinformatics analyses. These and other topics are covered in this review article.Bioinformatics has become an important component in clinical laboratories generating, analyzing, maintaining, and interpreting data from molecular genetics testing. Given the rapid adoption of NGS-based clinical testing, service providers must develop informatics work flows that adhere to the rigor of clinical laboratory standards, yet are flexible to changes as the chemistry and software for analyzing sequencing data mature.}",

The availability of massive amounts of GWAS data has necessitated the development of new biostatistical methods for quality control, imputation and analysis issues including multiple testing. This work has been successful and has enabled the discovery of new associations that have been replicated in multiple studies. However, it is now recognized that most SNPs discovered via GWAS have small effects on disease susceptibility and thus may not be suitable for improving health care through genetic testing. One likely explanation for the mixed results of GWAS is that the current biostatistical analysis paradigm is by design agnostic or unbiased in that it ignores all prior knowledge about disease pathobiology. Further, the linear modeling framework that is employed in GWAS often considers only one SNP at a time thus ignoring their genomic and environmental context. There is now a shift away from the biostatistical approach toward a more holistic approach that recognizes the complexity of the genotype–phenotype relationship that is characterized by significant heterogeneity and gene–gene and gene–environment interaction. We argue here that bioinformatics has an important role to play in addressing the complexity of the underlying genetic basis of common human diseases. The goal of this review is to identify and discuss those GWAS challenges that will require computational methods.Contact:jason.h.moore@dartmouth.edu}",

The complexity of the aging phenotype and the near impossibility of studying aging directly in humans oblige researchers to resort to models and extrapolations. Computational approaches offer a powerful set of tools to study human aging. In one direction we have data-mining methods, from comparative genomics to DNA microarrays, to retrieve information in large amounts of data. Afterwards, tools from systems biology to reverse engineering algorithms allow researchers to integrate different types of information to increase our knowledge about human aging. Computer methodologies will play a crucial role to reconstruct the genetic network of human aging and the associated regulatory mechanisms.}

	Abstract = {Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death in adults older than 65 years. The estimated total healthcare costs for the treatment of Alzheimer disease in 2020 is estimated at $305 billion, with the cost expected to increase to more than $1 trillion as the population ages. Most of the direct costs of care for Alzheimer disease are attributed to skilled nursing care, home healthcare, and hospice care. Indirect costs of care, including quality of life and informal caregiving, are likely underestimated and are associated with significant negative societal and personal burden. Managed care organizations are in a unique position to develop utilization strategies that would positively impact early diagnosis and treatment to lead to better outcomes and lower costs for patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Additionally, the recent inclusion of Alzheimer disease diagnoses into risk corridor calculations by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services may encourage Medicare Advantage organizations to invest in programs that aid in its early detection and diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing is one of the most important mechanisms to generate a large number of mRNA and protein isoforms from the surprisingly low number of human genes. Unlike promoter activity, which primarily regulates the amount of transcripts, alternative splicing changes the structure of transcripts and their encoded proteins. Together with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), at least 25% of all alternative exons are predicted to regulate transcript abundance. Molecular analyses during the last decade demonstrate that alternative splicing determines the binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, protein stability and posttranslational modifications of a large number of proteins. The magnitude of the effects range from a complete loss of function or acquisition of a new function to very subtle modulations, which are observed in the majority of cases reported. Alternative splicing factors regulate multiple pre-mRNAs and recent identification of physiological targets shows that a specific splicing factor regulates pre-mRNAs with coherent biological functions. Therefore, evidence is now accumulating that alternative splicing coordinates physiologically meaningful changes in protein isoform expression and is a key mechanism to generate the complex proteome of multicellular organisms.}

To investigate it, we labeled native mRNP particles in living Chironomus tentans salivary gland cells with fluorescent hrp36, the hnRNP A1 homolog, and the nuclear envelope by fluorescent NTF2. Using light sheet microscopy, we traced single native mRNA particles across the nuclear envelope. The particles were observed to often probe nuclear pore complexes (NPC) at their nuclear face, and in only 25\% of the cases yielded actual export. The complete export process took between 65\&nbsp;ms up to several seconds. A rate-limiting step was observed, which could be assigned to the nuclear basket of the pore and might correspond to a repositioning and unfolding of mRNPs before the actual translocation. Analysis of single fluorescent Dbp5 molecules, the RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, revealed that Dbp5 most often approached the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, and exhibited a binding duration of approximately 55\&nbsp;ms. Our results have allowed a refinement of the current models for mRNA export.}
